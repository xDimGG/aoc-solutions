# What is AOC?
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. 

# Why?
I just do these for fun. They provide neat challenges that usually lead to me learning about more efficient algorithms. The community behind AOC is pretty great and very competitive.
