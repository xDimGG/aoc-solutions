# What is AOC?
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language. 

# Why?
I just do these for fun. They provide neat challenges that usually lead to me learning about more efficient algorithms. The community behind AOC is pretty great and very competitive.

# Where are all the days?
I've only mostly done 2021 and 2022. Some of the problems for 2021 have already been completed on my desktop PC. These are just the problems I solved from my laptop. I may find my old solutions and share them one day. They were in Rust, though.
